    "content": "Top 6 things to do in Amsterdam There\u2019s more to Amsterdam than just the storybook charm of its Golden Age architecture and quaint canals. This pocket-size city likes to think big. Its acclaimed museums hold the world\u2019s largest collection of Van Goghs along with impressive Rembrandts, Vermeers, and modern masters. While its eco-friendly attitude and proud history of embracing diversity has long attracted international attention. With so much going for it, we\u2019ve made it easier for you by sharing our top picks. From the Rijksmuseum\u2019s homegrown collection to Anne Frank\u2019s heart-rending house, discover the best the city has to offer. And don\u2019t forget to soak up some gezellig, the Dutch concept of coziness, at any number of bruin caf\u00e9s. 1. Rijksmuseum Brimming with Dutch masterpieces such as Rembrandt\u2019s The Night Watch, this museum is a must for art lovers. With over 8000 works on display, it\u2019s impossible to see it all; head to the 2nd-floor Gallery of Honour for Golden Age art if you\u2019re short on time. The intricate Delft pottery is also worth a look. 2. Van Gogh Museum With the world\u2019s largest collection of Van Goghs, there\u2019s no better place to explore the life and works of this troubled genius. Housing a mix of lesser-known drawings and famed paintings, it shows the fascinating transition of Van Gogh\u2019s style, from somber Dutch landscapes to bright, swirling sunflowers. 3. Anne Frank\u2019s story For two terrifying years, Anne Frank and her family hid from the Nazis in the back of a canal house from 1635. Seeing the airless annex in real life is an unforgettable and emotionally charged experience. A tour can also show you her childhood haunts and the shop where she bought her now-famous diary. 4. Canal tours Floating down its many canals is one of the most atmospheric ways to see the city sights. Extending around 62 miles, these canals are an iconic symbol of Amsterdam, while the picturesque 17th-century ring area is also UNESCO World Heritage Listed. Options range from general tickets to a luxury experience. 5. Bike riding In a country said to have more bikes than people, it\u2019s only natural that the best way to explore the city is by bike. Not only do you get to experience Amsterdam like a local, but with over 320 miles of dedicated lanes it\u2019s also a convenient way to get around. Less confident riders can opt for an easy bike tour. 6. Dutch countrysideCrisscrossed by canals and dotted with windmills, the Dutch countryside is as picturesque as it gets. Take a day trip from Amsterdam and discover the attractions just outside it. Top places to visit include Marken island, with its wooden homes, the windmills of Zaanse Schans, and the flower-filled fields of Keukenhof GardensPlanning your Amsterdam visit When to go? June to August is the peak tourist season which means there will be greater crowds, but you may be willing to brave them for the warm weather (perfect for cycling) and long days. Those wishing to avoid said crowds should come before or after the tourist peak season, between April and May or September and November. Good weather can\u2019t be guaranteed, but it\u2019ll be mild and at least you can enjoy the city at its laid-back best. March to May is also the time to catch those famed tulips in bloom. For those who don\u2019t mind the cold and the short days, winter is an ideal time to nab a deal. Flights and accommodation are likely to be at their lowest. Plus, if the weather ever gets too much for you, you can always warm up in a cozy bruin caf\u00e9. How many days should you spend? This varies a lot depending on your traveling style. If you\u2019re someone who likes an action-packed itinerary, you can see the main sights in two days as it\u2019s a pretty compact city. If instead, you\u2019re someone who likes to take it a bit slower and get into the rhythm of local life, you could take a week or even more. This will give you the time to explore the city on foot or with a bike tour, and let you include day trips to Zaanse Schans to see the windmills or Keukenhof to wander in the tulip fields. How to get there? Schiphol International Airport (also known as Amsterdam Airport) is the Netherlands \u2019 main airport and also one of Europe\u2019s busiest. A convenient 5 miles from Amsterdam, it\u2019s well-connected by trains that depart for Centraal Station around every 10 minutes from 6 am to 1 am; it runs hourly between 2 am and 5 am. The trip takes 15 minutes and tickets cost \u20ac5.50. Otherwise, the Connexxion Airport Express bus gets you to the center in 30 minutes (\u20ac6.50 one way; \u20ac11.25 return). Taxis cost around \u20ac45. How to move around the city? Amsterdam is a compact city, which makes getting around relatively easy. If you\u2019re only going to be exploring the city center, you can get almost everywhere on foot. If you plan on using public transport, we recommend you get a 1- to 7-day GVB pass (available at GVB ticket offices). For most visitors, a combination of walking and taking trams will be all they need. Buses and trains are mainly used to connect to outer suburbs. Most locals get around by bike and if you feel like following their lead the city is well-equipped with bike lanes and rentals. Taxis are readily available, although they tend to be slower because of the maze-like streets. Where to shop? For shopping in the most photogenic of settings, nothing quite beats Negen Straatjes (Nine Streets). These narrow streets connecting the 17th-century canals are filled with historic charm and a mix of quirky vintage stores, hip cafes, trendy boutiques, and art galleries. Otherwise, if you\u2019re looking for something a little bit more laid-back and local then De Pijp is the place for you. It has cool concept stores, local Dutch design, and a fantastic open-air market. Luxury lovers instead will want to strut their stuff down PC Hooftstraat, home to haute-couture brands such as Louis Vuitton, Mulberry, and DKNY. Finally, for antiques and art look no further than Spiegelkwartier, where you can splurge on everything from Delft pottery to 17th-century furniture.",

    "content": "Top 6 things to do in ParisThe City of Lights needs no introduction. For centuries it\u2019s enthralled visitors and inspired the work of some of the world\u2019s most acclaimed writers and artists, from Victor Hugo to Van Gogh. Iconic monuments, world-class museums, elegant boulevards, and impossibly chic inhabitants are all part of its charm. So where to begin in this impeccable city? From its soaring Eiffel Tower to the boldly modern Centre Pompidou and sculpted Arc de Triomphe, we show you the best the city has to offer. And let\u2019s not forget its glorious gastronomy, from delicate pastries to the humble baguette and creamy cheeses accompanied by earthy local wines. Discover it all and let this mesmerizing city cast its spell on you.1. Eiffel TowerConstructed by Gustave Eiffel for the 1889 World\u2019s Fair, it\u2019s hard to believe this iconic tower was ever intended to be temporary. Saved by its potential use as a radio antena, it\u2019s become one of Paris\u2019 most enduring symbols. Head to the third floor for city views (that get especially romantic at night).2. Louvre MuseumThere\u2019s more to the Louvre than its gleaming glass pyramid and Da Vinci\u2019s mysterious Mona Lisa. Home to more than 10,000 works, its collection runs the gamut from Egyptian antiques to Dutch masters such as Vermeer and Rembrandt. Highlights include the ancient Winged Victory of Samothrace and Venus de Milo.3. Arc de TriompheBegun in 1806 in honor of Napol\u00e9on\u2019s recent victory at Austerlitz, it was another 20 years before his monumental arch was finally complete. Highlights include intricate sculptures such as D\u00e9part des Volontaires de 1792 (Departure of the Volunteers of 1792). You can also climb the 284 steps for sweeping views.4. Musee RodinGet to know this famed sculptor in the 18th-century mansion he used to call home. While many of his works are in the mansion itself, his most famous sculptures can be found in the surrounding rose garden. Exuding tranquility, the latter is the perfect place to ponder one of his greatest works: The Thinker.5. Centre PompidouFormer French president George Pompidou wanted a game-changing museum and he certainly got it. Famed for Its radical inside-out architecture, the museum houses cutting-edge exhibitions, performances, cinemas and an enviable permanent collection of French art. Don\u2019t miss the panoramic view from the rooftop.6. French gastronomyHome to one of the world\u2019s most renowned cuisines, there\u2019s no excuse for not indulging in some fantastic foods, such as a light-as-air macaroon or some creamy camembert. Make your way from artisanal boulangeries to exquisite patisseries, cosy bistros and Michelin-star restaurants; you won\u2019t be disappointed.Planning your Paris visitWhen to go?Paris will charm you regardless of the season. That said, the months from April to May and September to October are widely considered the best times to visit. You\u2019ll miss the summer crowds while also getting to enjoy the mild yet sunny weather. Spring also lets you see the city in full bloom. Summer is the peak tourist season (June to August), when the weather is at its best and brightest and attractions are at their busiest. Some local establishments may also close during August. Winter is better for those looking to nab a deal as prices for both flights and accommodation tend to drop. Sights are less packed, although you\u2019ll never have them to yourself as Paris attracts tourists all year round.How many days should you spend?Paris is a cosmopolitan city brimming with culture, history, shopping and fantastic nightlife. Three days might just be enough to pack in some of its main sights, but keep in mind you\u2019d be on a tight schedule. Instead, we recommend you get to know the city at a more leisurely pace by spending five days to a week. This way you can see the city\u2019s top attractions while also discovering its more hidden local side.How to get there?Charles de Gaulle is the city\u2019s main airport and is connected to central Paris by train (RER) and bus; prices range from \u20ac6 to \u20ac18. If you're in a hurry a taxi is the fastest way to get into town (45 minutes) and costs \u20ac55-60.Orly Airport is 13km south of Paris. Getting to the city center is a little less direct unless you take a taxi (\u20ac35). If you go by train, you\u2019ll have to change at the Antony station to lines RER B or RER C. It costs around \u20ac12 one way. Otherwise, the Orlybus will take you direct for \u20ac8.30 one way.Beauvais Airport is a small airport 80 km from Paris, which is mostly used by low-cost airlines. It takes 80 minutes approximately by airport shuttle to Porte Maillot (\u20ac17). Trains run to Gare du Nord station every 1 to 2 hours and cost \u20ac13-\u20ac16.How to move around the city?While the city is by no means small, it\u2019s relatively easy getting around thanks to a speedy and efficient public transport system. The Metro and RER are the fastest modes of transport and operate from around 5:30 am to 1:15 am (Fridays and Saturdays the Metro stays open an hour later). There\u2019s also a bus system run by RATP, which may be more convenient for families with strollers and those with limited mobility. Prices start from \u20ac1.90 for a single bus\/train ticket. Paris is also becoming increasingly bike-friendly and this is a scenic way to explore the city. While you\u2019ll spot various bike-share systems throughout the city such as V\u00e9lib', not all will accept foreign credit cards.Where to shop?With its well-heeled locals and chic boutiques, this is a city that knows a thing or two about style. Get your sartorial dose at any number of shopping districts. The Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 is the beating heart of designer fashion, with flagships stores from big-name brands such as Versace and Hermes. Otherwise, if you\u2019re looking for something more niche head to Marais, which has everything from artisanal jewelers to trendy concept stores like Merci. Vintage lovers will go wild in Paris\u2019 many flea markets; Saint-Ouen is the city\u2019s largest and is a veritable treasure trove of pre-loved goods. Additionally, you can\u2019t leave Paris without strolling through one of its covered arcades famed for their old-world beauty, such as the Galerie Vivienne.",
